//Features to implement

/*

I'll help you create a strong approach for this RBAC UI assignment. Let me break down the key aspects and provide recommendations:



First, regarding Syncfusion - while you could use it, I would recommend using some alternatives for this assessment:

1. shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS - This would be ideal because:
   - It's free and open source
   - Highly customizable
   - Modern and professional looking
   - Lightweight compared to Syncfusion
   - Shows your ability to work with modern UI libraries

Key Features to Include:

1. Core RBAC Features:
   - User Management dashboard with table view
   - Role creation and editing interface
   - Permission matrix
   - Bulk actions for efficiency
   - Search and filter capabilities

2. Advanced Features to Stand Out:
   - Role hierarchy visualization
   - Permission inheritance map
   - Activity logs
   - User session management
   - Role templates for quick setup
   - Permission groups for better organization


Technical Recommendations:

1. State Management:
   - Use React Context for global state
   - Implement Redux only if necessary (might be overkill for this assessment)

2. Data Handling:
   - Mock API using MSW (Mock Service Worker)
   - Implement proper loading and error states
   - Add data validation

3. Performance Considerations:
   - Implement pagination for large data sets
   - Use virtualization for long lists
   - Implement debouncing for search
   - Lazy load components

4. Security Best Practices:
   - Input sanitization
   - Proper error handling
   - Session management
   - CSRF protection simulation
   - XSS prevention

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects or show you how to implement specific features? I can also help you set up the project structure or create more detailed components.
